 The Long Dark blueprint pack
 requires ModComponent

the mod consists of 3 parts
Base:
- crafting non-hide clothing for most clothing slots
- making tinder back into sticks
- making reclaimed wood form sticks (keeping the burn time the same)
- pretending a heap of charcoal is a piece of coal
- crafting firestriker
- reparing whetstone

Hides:
- create synthetic hides using cloth and leather
- sewing together smaler hides to create bigger ones
- harvesting hides for cloth OR leather (I could not fugure out how to properly do rarvesting blueprins so only one output)
- "burning" of moose hides into 1 cloth if for some reason you have too many of them (like you decided that related blueprints should be harder)

Blanket:
- if you don't have the BlanketMod use this to craft GEAR_ClothSheet (note it will not provide any warmth bonus)
- if you do have thet mod I recomend using weight of 0.8km as my blueprints are ballanced around 8 cloth per blanket as vanilla harvest blueprit suggests.
